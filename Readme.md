## Foreword

This is a set of personal notes on software craftsmanship. Many things gathered here are not new, some of them are well-known! It is mainly thoughts on my activity as a software craftsmanship coach in several different teams I had the pleasure to work with.

So what could be the value of such a work, since there are so many stuff on katas all around the Internet? Well, first of all, it acts as a block-note for me, with everything in one place. Instead of having a bunch of links, some of them broken, and annotations on what has been published somewhere else, at least everything is here. Second, since this is GitHub, this work can be commented, criticized, improved. From discussions come new ideas. I am convinced that exposing a work can improve it, so let's give a try on this subject!
