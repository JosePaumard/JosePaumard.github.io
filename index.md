# Software Craftsmanship

## Foreword

This is a set of personal notes on software craftsmanship. Many things gathered here are not new, some of them are well-known! It is mainly thoughts on my activity as a software craftsmanship coach in several different teams I had the pleasure to work with.

Most of these katas can be found somewhere else on the Internet, and sorry, I did not try to find out who invented which. Well some of them, I know I invented them, but it is so easy to invent a kata that I cannot be sure that someone somewhere came with the same idea.

Anyway, here is a list a very good (and well known!) readings if you want to learn more about clean code, software craftsmanship, and all the practices around those.
