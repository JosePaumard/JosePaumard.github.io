## The Palindrome Kata

The Palindrome kata is about telling if a given sentence can be red in both ways: from the left to the right (which is the classical way of reading in most latin languages) and from the right to the left.

For instance:

- Dad, mum, Bob, Eve are palindromes
- level, radar, rotor, reviver, redivider are other examples of palindromes.

Sentences can be palindromes too:

- Noel sees Leon.

### The Kata

We want to create a method that takes a string of characters as its input, and returns a boolean that is true if the input string is a palindrome. One can use examples from the text file ``palindromes.txt``. [this file is provided with the code of the kata].
